Problem Statement - Utility Static Methods
Complete the static methods in the class Utility as per following requirements

Method fahrenheitToCelcius :

-This method should convert farhenheit in to celcius based on the formula
 [celcius = (farhenheit - 32) X 5 / 9]
-The method takes farhenheit(double) as input parameter
-Method should return calculated temperature celcius rounded to an integer

Method getLevel :

-Takes an integer array as input parameter
-Should calculate the sum of all array elements and return a String as per below rules
-HIGH - when sum is greater than or equal to 100, MEDIUM - when sum is greater than or equal to 70, LOW - when sum is less than 70

Complete the main method in class Source as below

-Program should take console input and call appropriate methods of Utility class based on the input
-Input and Output sample formats are given below in Example section
-First input should be option 1 or 2. Option 1 is for Celcius calculation;Option 2 for finding Level
-In case of option 1, the second input should be temperature in farhenheit
-In case of option 2, the second input should be number of elements in the array, followed by the array elements
-In case of incorrect option, program should display 'Invalid Option'
