Complete the method getSumOfListElements(..) that accepts two lists of type List<Integer> as arguments.
The sizes of both Lists may differ.
Assuming that the sizes of both lists are 's1' and 's2', the function should create a new list of size equals to largest of s1 and s2.
An element in the returned list is the sum of elements in input lists at the same index.
For example, if L1 and L2 are input lists, and L3 is the returned list, then L3.get(n) must be equal to the sum of L1.get(n) and L2.get(n).
If L1 is larger than L2 then the last (s1-s2) elements in the returned list should be same as the corresponding elements in the list L1
If any of the list is null, it should be considered as empty list

The main method contains the code which does the following
Input is taken through console.
Lists are created and passed to the getSumOfListElements method
The returned list is printed

Example
Sample Console Input:
	"10, 20, 30, 40, 50"
	"12, 23, 34"
Sample Output:
	[22, 43, 64, 40, 50]
